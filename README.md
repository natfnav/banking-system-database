# Project Overview
Our project is all about building a database for a banking organization. This organization will serve 
the banking needs of customers, who will be conducting their transactions at physical bank
locations staffed by tellers and bank managers. The main purpose of the database is to track
the transactions and current balance of customersâ€™ accounts, with a secondary purpose of
tracking the staffing and transaction metrics of individual bank locations. The customer will be
able to view their account balance, while the tellers will process transactions (deposit/withdraw/transfer). 
The database will also keep track of management and employee responsibilities.

# Deliverable
A desktop application that enables users to manage the database.
